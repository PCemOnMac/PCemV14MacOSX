3D accelerated SVGA cards :


Diamond Stealth 3D 2000
S3 ViRGE/325 based. 2-4MB VRAM.

PCem emulates the ViRGE S3D engine in software. This works with most games I tried, but
there may be some issues. The Direct3D drivers for the /325 are fairly poor (often showing
as missing triangles), so use of the /DX instead is recommended.

The streams processor (video overlay) is also emulated, however many features are missing.

ROM files needed:
 s3virge.bin


S3 ViRGE/DX
S3 ViRGE/DX based. 2-4MB VRAM.

The drivers that come with Windows are similar to those for the /325, however better ones
do exist (try the 8-21-1997 version). With the correct drivers, many early Direct3D games
work okay (if slowly).

ROM files needed:
86c375_1.bin


3D only cards :

3DFX Voodoo Graphics
3D accelerator. Widely supported in late 90s games.

PCem emulates this in software. The emulation is a lot faster than in v10 (thanks to a new
dynamic recompiler) and should be capable of hitting Voodoo 1 performance on most machines
when two render threads are used. As before, the emulated CPU is the bottleneck for most games.

PCem can emulate 6 and 8 MB configurations, but defaults to 4 MB for compatibility. It can also
emulate the screen filter present on the original card, though this does at present have a
noticeable performance hit.

Almost everything I've tried works okay, with a very few exceptions - Screamer 2 and Rally have
serious issues.


Obsidian SB50
Voodoo Graphics with 2 TMUs. Drivers for this are a bit limited - the official drivers don't
support 2 TMUs in Direct3D.


Voodoo 2
Improved Voodoo Graphics - higher clocks, 2 TMUs, triangle setup etc.

PCem can emulate both 8 and 12 MB configurations. It can also emulate 6 and 10 MB configurations
(with 2MB framebuffer memory), which were never sold into the PC market but do exist for arcade
systems.


Some models have fixed graphics adapters :

Amstrad MegaPC
Paradise 90C11. A development of the PVGA1, with 512kb VRAM. Can use external video card.

Acer 386SX/25N
Oak OTI-067. Another 512kb SVGA clone. Can use external video card.

Amstrad PC1512
CGA with a new mode (640x200x16).

Amstrad PC1640
Paradise EGA. Can use external video card.

Amstrad PC2086/PC3086
Paradise PVGA1. An early SVGA clone with 256kb VRAM. Can use external video card.

Elonex PC-425X
Trident TGUI9400CXi with 512kb VRAM.

IBM PCjr
CGA with various new modes - 160x200x16, 320x200x16, 640x200x4.

IBM PS/1 Model 2011
Stock VGA with 256kb VRAM.

IBM PS/1 Model 2121
Basic (and unknown) SVGA with 256kb VRAM.

IBM PS/2 machines
Stock VGA with 256kb VRAM.

Olivetti M24
CGA with double-res text modes and a 640x400 mode. I haven't seen a dump of the font
ROM for this yet, so if one is not provided the MDA font will be used - which looks slightly odd
as it is 14-line instead of 16-line.

Packard Bell PB520R
Cirrus Logic GD-5434. Can use external video card.

Packard Bell PB570
Cirrus Logic GD-5430. Can use external video card.

Sinclair PC200
CGA. Can use external video card.

Tandy 1000
Clone of PCjr video. Widely supported in 80s games.

Tandy 1000 SL/2
Improvement of Tandy 1000, with support for 640x200x16.

Toshiba T-series
CGA on built-in LCD or plasma display.



PCem emulates the following sound devices :

PC speaker
The standard beeper on all PCs. Supports samples/RealSound.

Tandy PSG
The Texas Instruments chip in the PCjr and Tandy 1000. Supports 3 voices plus
noise. I reused the emulator in B-em for this (slightly modified).
PCem emulates the differences between the SN76496 (PCjr and Tandy 1000), and the NCR8496
(currently assigned to the Tandy 1000HX). Maniac Mansion and Zak McKraken will only sound
correct on the latter.

Tandy PSSJ
Used on the Tandy 1000SL/2, this clones the NCR8496, adding an addition frequency divider (did any
software actually use this?) and an 8-bit DAC.

PS/1 audio card
An SN76496 clone plus an 8-bit DAC. The SN76496 isn't at the same address as PCjr/Tandy, so most
software doesn't support it.

Gameblaster
The Creative Labs Gameblaster/Creative Music System, Creative's first sound card
introduced in 1987. Has two Philips SAA1099, giving 12 voices of square waves plus 4 noise
voices. In stereo!

Adlib
Has a Yamaha YM3812, giving 9 voices of 2 op FM, or 6 voices plus a rhythm section. PCem
uses the DOSBox dbopl emulator.

Adlib Gold
OPL3 with YM318Z 12-bit digital section. Possibly some bugs (not a lot of software to test).
The surround module is now emulated.

Sound Blaster
Several Sound Blasters are emulated :
    SB v1.0 - The original. Limited to 22khz, and no auto-init DMA (can cause crackles sometimes).
    SB v1.5 - Adds auto-init DMA
    SB v2.0 - Upped to 41khz
    SB Pro v1.0 - Stereo, with twin OPL2 chips.
    SB Pro v2.0 - Stereo, with OPL 3 chip
    SB 16 - 16 bit stereo
    SB AWE32 - SB 16 + wavetable MIDI. This requires a ROM dump from a real AWE32.
All are set to Address 220, IRQ 7 and DMA 1 (and High DMA 5). IRQ and DMA can be changed for the 
SB16 & AWE32 in the drivers.
The relevant SET line for autoexec.bat is
  SET BLASTER = A220 I7 D1 Tx    - where Tx is T1 for SB v1.0, T3 for SB v2.0, T4 for SB Pro,
				   and T6 for SB16.

AWE32 requires a ROM dump called awe32.raw. AWE-DUMP is a utility which can get a dump from a real
card. Most EMU8000 functionality should work, however filters are not correct and reverb/chorus
effects are not currently emulated.

Gravis Ultrasound
32 voice sample playback. Port address is fixed to 240, IRQ and DMA can be changed from the drivers.
Emulation is improved significantly over previous versions.

Windows Sound System
16-bit digital + OPL3. Note that this only emulates WSS itself, and should not be used with drivers
from compatible boards with additional components (eg Turtle Beach Monte Carlo)

Innovation SSI-2001
SID6581. Emulated using resid-fp. Board is fixed to port 280.

Ensoniq AudioPCI (ES1371) / Sound Blaster PCI 128
Basic PCI sound card. Emulates Sound Blaster in software.


PCem emulates the following hard drive controllers :

[MFM] Fixed Disk Adapter (Xebec)
MFM controller originally included in the IBM XT. This controller only supports HD types 0, 2, 13
and 16.

ROM files needed :
ibm_xebec_62x0822_1985.bin


[MFM] DTC 5150X
8-bit MFM controller. To configure drive types, run DEBUG.EXE and enter 'g=c800:5'.

ROM files needed :
dtc_cxd21a.bin


[MFM] AT Fixed Disk Adapter
MFM controller originally included in the IBM AT. Supported by all AT-compatible BIOSes.


[ESDI] Western Digital WD1007V-SE1
16-bit ESDI controller.

ROM files needed :
62-000279-061.bin


[ESDI] IBM ESDI Fixed Disk Controller
MCA ESDI controller. Only supported on PS/2 models.

ROM files needed :
90x8969.bin
90x8970.bin


[IDE] Standard IDE
Standard IDE controller. Supported by all AT-compatible BIOSes. Use this if in any doubt!


[IDE] XTIDE
8-bit IDE controller. The BIOS is available at :

http://code.google.com/p/xtideuniversalbios/

ROM files needed :
ide_xt.bin


[IDE] XTIDE (AT)
16-bit IDE controller.

ROM files needed :
ide_at.bin


[IDE] XTIDE (PS/1)
IDE controller for the PS/1 model 2033. For this machine you will need BIOS version v1.1.5. The
PS/1 is a bit fussy with XTIDE, and I've found that it works best when the XTIDE configuration
has 'Full Operating Mode' disabled.

ROM files needed :
ide_at_1_1_5.bin


[SCSI] Longshine LCS-6821N
8-bit SCSI controller.

ROM files needed :
Longshine LCS-6821N - BIOS version 1.04.bin

ROM files needed :
BusLogic_BT-545S_U15_27128_5002026-4.50.bin


Other stuff emulated :

Serial mouse
A Microsoft compatible serial mouse on COM1. Compatible drivers are all over the place for this.

M24 mouse
I haven't seen a DOS mouse driver for this yet, but the regular scancode mode works, as does the
Windows 1.x driver.

PC1512 mouse
The PC1512's perculiar quadrature mouse. You need Amstrad's actual driver for this one.

PS/2 mouse
A standard 2 button PS/2 mouse. As with serial, compatible drivers are common.

Microsoft PS/2 Intellimouse
A PS/2 mouse with mouse wheel.

ATAPI CD-ROM
Works with OAKCDROM.SYS, VDD-IDE.SYS, and the internal drivers of every OS I've tried.
